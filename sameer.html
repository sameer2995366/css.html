   <h1>Inline</h1>
   <p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element. <br>
     An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.</p>
   <h1>Internal</h1>
   <p>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. <br>
     An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page. <br>
      The following example sets the color of the elements to blue,
         and the <br> color of ALL the elements to red.</p>
         <h1>External</h1>
         <p>An external style sheet is a file with a . css extension that contains <br>
             cascading style sheet (CSS) definitions for a webpage(s). <br> It completely separates
              the CSS styles from the HTML document <br> making it easy to reuse and maintain.</p>
              <h1>Id</h1>
              <p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. <br>
                 The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select <br>
                  one unique element! To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) <br>
                   character, followed by the id of the element.</p>
                   <h1>Class</h1>
                   <p>In CSS, a class is a group of elements that are the same or similar. <br>
                     You can have as many elements as you want in a class. And each element can <br>
                      be the member of multiple classes. Every class has CSS attributes <br>
                       (like color and font-size) that are specific to that class. CSS classes are <br>
                        similar to a real-life class.</p>
                       <h1>Tag name</h1>
                       <p>The  tag is used to define information  for  document. Inside the styl you <br>
                         specify how elements should render in  browser.</p>
